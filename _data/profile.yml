  <p>
    I am a mathematician with a strong background in applied modeling and computational analysis. My current work focuses on the integration of uncertainty-aware predictive models into decision-making processes for complex systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through my doctoral research, I explore how changes in behavior and incomplete information impact the effectiveness of emergency response strategies. At DataLab, I contribute to the development of data-driven tools for assessing health risks, optimizing interventions, and supporting public sector decision-making.
