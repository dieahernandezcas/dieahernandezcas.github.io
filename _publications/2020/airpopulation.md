  Due to the emergency arising from Covid-19 and the mandatory confinement decreed in Colombia on March 25, 2020, there is an opportunity to review indicators that are associated with respiratory diseases in the country and assess whether the isolations decreed by the national government had anyi mpact on the decrease thereof. The objective of this study is to review the variation in carbon monoxide (CO) present in the air breathed by the inhabitants of the department of Cundinamarca (Colombia) during the first 6 months of 2019 and 2020. The selected time period corresponds to the emergency by Covid-19 from its beginnings until the reopening of economic activities, compared to the same period of 2019 with an industry working at full throttle.

  With the data provided by Sentinel 5P – Level 2 Tropomi sensor, monthly CO images were created that were downloaded for the period of interest with the help of Google Earth Engine. Subsequently a pixel-by-pixel analysis was performed with the help of Python. Finally, images of carbon monoxide variation were represented in the QGIS software. Results of this study, although they show a significant variation specifically in the months of March and April, show the need to strengthen regulation on air quality issues in a country increasingly burdened by air pollution
